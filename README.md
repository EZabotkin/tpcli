# The Power CLI

The [`tp` CLI](https://doc.thepower.io/docs/Maintain/tools/tp-cli) utility is a powerful tool, that will help you:

- generate keys (secp256k1 and ed25519);
- register your IP address;
- form the transactions from a JSON-formatted template;
- sign the transactions (including signing using multiple keys).

The tool consists of two parts:

- [generic part](https://doc.thepower.io/docs/Maintain/tools/tp-cli#generic-part-commands);
- [storage part](https://doc.thepower.io/docs/Maintain/tools/tp-cli#storage-part-commands).

You can find the description of `tp` CLI under the link above.
